        <h1>Some Mechanical processes</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ultrasonic Machining</h2>
            <p>
                Ultrasonic machining is a mechanical material removal process that utilizes high-frequency vibrations
                generated by ultrasonic waves to remove material from a workpiece. A vibrating tool, typically a cutting
                tool or abrasive slurry, is applied to the workpiece's surface under controlled pressure. The
                high-frequency vibrations cause the abrasive particles to impact the workpiece, resulting in material
                removal in a precise and controlled manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process is effective for machining hard and brittle materials like ceramics, glass, and certain
                composites. It offers advantages such as high precision, minimal thermal stress on the workpiece, and
                the ability to create intricate shapes that may be challenging to achieve using conventional machining
                methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the setup and tooling for ultrasonic machining can be complex, and the process might be
                relatively slower compared to other methods for bulk material removal.

            <h2>Abrasive Jet Machining</h2>
            <p>
                Abrasive jet machining is a mechanical material removal process that uses a high-velocity stream of
                abrasive particles propelled by compressed air or gas to erode the workpiece material. This process
                involves a nozzle that directs the abrasive stream towards the workpiece, removing material by erosion.
                It is often used for cutting, drilling, and shaping brittle or hard materials where precision and
                intricate shapes are required.
            </p>
            <p>
                The abrasive particles used can be materials like aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, or garnet. By
                controlling the velocity and concentration of the abrasive stream, various surface finishes and material
                removal rates can be achieved. Abrasive jet machining is advantageous for its ability to cut intricate
                patterns, its suitability for thin and fragile materials, and its minimal heat generation during the
                process.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this process might have limitations in terms of material removal rates for thicker materials
                and may require frequent nozzle replacement due to wear caused by abrasive particles.

            <h2>Abrasive Water Jet Machining</h2>
            <p>
                Abrasive water jet machining is a mechanical process that utilizes a high-velocity stream of pressurized
                water mixed with abrasive particles to cut or machine various materials. This method combines water
                pressure with abrasives to create a powerful cutting tool capable of machining materials like metals,
                composites, stone, and glass. It offers advantages such as no heat-affected zone, minimal material
                waste, and the ability to cut complex shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The process involves a nozzle that ejects a fine, high-velocity stream of abrasive-laden water onto the
                workpiece. The kinetic energy from the jet, combined with the abrasive particles, erodes the material.
                This method is suitable for materials with varying hardness and thickness and can produce precise cuts
                without creating significant mechanical stresses or heat-affected zones in the workpiece.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its advantages, abrasive water jet machining may have limitations in achieving extremely high
                precision on intricate features and may require specialized equipment and maintenance for optimal
                performance.
