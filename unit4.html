        <h1>Drilling</h1>
        Drilling is a process of making hole or enlarging a hole in an object by forcing a rotating tool called “Drill”.
        The drill is generally called as ‘twist drill’. it has a sharp twisted edges formed around a cylindrical tool
        provided with a helical groove along its length to allow the cut material to escape through it.

        <h2>Principle of drilling</h2>
        A drilling machine operates on the principle of rotating a multi-point cutting tool, known as a drill bit, to
        create
        cylindrical holes in a workpiece. The drill bit applies axial force while rotating to remove material, producing
        holes with a circular cross-section.

            <h2>Principle and Construction of Lathe Machine</h2>
            <div>
                <pre style="font-size: larger;">
The principle behind the lathe machine lies in its mechanism of material removal through relative motion between the cutting tool and the wrokpiece.


Construction of Lathe Machine:

1. Bed:
   - Base providing a stable platform.
   - Usually made of cast iron to absorb vibrations.

2. Headstock:
   - Located at one end of the bed, holds the main spindle.
   - Contains driving motor and gearbox.

3. Tailstock:
   - Positioned opposite the headstock, supports the other end of the workpiece.
   - Adjustable along the bed's length.
   - Allows drilling and other operations.

4. Carriage:
   - Moves along the bed's ways.
   - Consists of saddle (supports tool post and cutting tool) and cross-slide.
   - Enables longitudinal and transverse movement for precise tool positioning.

5. Tool Post:
   - Mounted on the carriage, securely holds the cutting tool.
   - Various types (e.g., quick-change tool posts) allow rapid tool changes.

6. Apron:
   - Attached to the carriage, houses mechanisms for controlling movement.
   - Contains gears, clutches, and levers for engaging feeds and speeds.

7. Lead Screw:
   - Provides longitudinal carriage movement for threading operations.

8. Feed Rods:
   - Transmit motion to the carriage and cross-slide for controlled tool movement.

9. Chuck or Faceplate:
   - Attached to the spindle, holds the workpiece securely.

10. Motor:
    - Provides power to drive the spindle.

            <h2>Lathe Operations</h2>
            <div>
                <pre style="font-size: larger;">


1. Facing:
- Machining ends of a workpiece to produce a flat surface perpendicular to the axis.
- Done in two steps - rough and fine facing.

2. Plain Turning:
- Removing excess material from the cylindrical surface of the workpiece.
- Work held in chuck or between centers, providing longitudinal feed to the tool.

3. Step Turning:
- Creating steps of varying diameters in the workpiece.
- Similar to plain turning.

4. Taper Turning:
- Producing a conical surface by gradually reducing diameter from a cylindrical workpiece.
- Methods include:
     - setting over the tailstock center.
     - swiveling the compound rest.
     - By using a taper turning attachment.

5. Drilling:
- Producing cylindrical holes using a rotating cutting edge tool (drill).
- Work held in chuck or faceplate while feeding the drill through the tailstock.

6. Reaming:
- Follows drilling for high-grade surface finish and dimensional accuracy.
- Utilizes a reamer with multiple cutting edges held on the tailstock spindle.

7. Boring:
- Enlarging and turning holes previously made by drilling, punching, casting, or forging.
- Utilizes a boring tool or bit fed into the work similar to turning.

8. Undercutting/Grooving:
- Reducing the diameter of a workpiece over a narrow surface, often near a thread or shoulder.
- Utilizes a grooving tool fed into the work.

9. Threading:
- Cutting helical grooves on the external cylindrical surface of the workpiece.
- Requires a threading tool fed longitudinally to the revolving work.

10. Knurling:
 - Embossing a diamond-shaped pattern on a workpiece surface for improved grip.
 - Performed using a special knurling tool pressed against the revolving workpiece.

11. Forming:
 - Turning convex, concave, or irregular shapes.
 - Achieved using forming tools, combining cross and longitudinal feeds, or tracing a template.

                <h2> Types of Lathes:</h2>
                <pre style="font-size: larger;">

1. Speed Lathe:
   - Spindle rotates at very high speed using a variable speed motor in the headstock.
   - Used for woodwork, centering, metal spinning, and polishing.

2. Engine or Centre Lathe:
   - Most common type, widely used in workshops.
   - Variable spindle speed control for cutting as desiired which is not possible in speed lathe.
   - Carriage allows tool feed in cross and longitudinal directions.

3. Bench Lathe:
   - Mounted on a bench, smaller in size.
   - Handles small work with accurate like in production of gauges, punches, and press tool beds.

4. Tool Room Lathe:
   - Similar to engine lathe, designed for precision and accuracy.
   - Used for manufacturing precision components, dies, tools, and jigs.

5. Turret and Capstan Lathes:
   - Hold multiple tools for a wide range of operations.
   - Suitable for mass production of identical parts efficiently.

6. Automatic Lathes:
   - Automatically feed and withdraw tools for operations.
   - Requires minimal operator attention, used for mass production.
